# CR2-Converter-Server

# This program is not secure. I can think of at least 3 ways to pull of command injection. DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION!

This is only intended as an example of how to use Flask to upload, use system commands for useful things, and return a download.
I wrote this program in about 30 min to solve a problem for a team I was working on. The nice Canon camera our photographer was using outputs CR2 image files; she needed them all in JPG format. 

To use this program, simply run the app, browse to port 80 on the host, and upload a ZIP of all the CR2 images to convert. The app will return a download link for a ZIP containing all of the converted CR2 images.

If you have anything to add, please do.
If you use it, give me a shoutout.
